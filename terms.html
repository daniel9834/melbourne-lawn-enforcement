We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time, and the revised version will be effective upon posting to this page.</p>

          <h2>3. Services</h2>
          <p>We provide property maintenance services as described on our website and as agreed upon in individual quotes or service agreements. The specific scope, frequency, and nature of services will be confirmed prior to commencement of any work.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right to refuse or discontinue services at our discretion, including but not limited to situations involving unsafe work conditions, access issues, or non-payment.</p>

          <h2>4. Quotes and Pricing</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>All quotes provided by Melbourne Lawn Enforcement are estimates and are valid for 30 days from the date of issue unless otherwise stated.</li>
            <li>Quotes are based on the information provided to us at the time of assessment. If site conditions differ materially from what was described or assessed, we reserve the right to adjust pricing accordingly.</li>

            <li>Additional work requested beyond the original scope of a quote may incur additional charges, which will be communicated and agreed upon before the work is carried out.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Bookings and Scheduling</h2>
          <p>Service appointments are scheduled based on availability. While we make every effort to attend at the agreed time, scheduling may be affected by weather conditions, equipment issues, or other unforeseen circumstances.
